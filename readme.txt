first of all, hope you doing well and not too busy.
basically got tired from wondering if it was discord that wasn't working properly and started looking for other ways to communicate, 

for the (assumed) problems with discord (and not you being busy off your arse) trying to reinstall discord might help? also, does the mobile app still work? 
that aside, we should figure out another backup platform so we can continue to work together even if one system falters (like has apparently been happening)

as a proof, would you mind changing something in this repository so I know you read it? :)
even, if you hypothetically would not want to talk to me (angsty mind is angsty) a really short reply would be greatly appreciated

cya soon
